Work with the dataset provided in the ames.csv file. This file has been pre-processed to simplify the analysis. The file contains 73 variables, described on the last page of this handout. The first variable characterizes the property's sale price -- which we aim to predict. The other variables describe the property in detail, both in quantitative terms (square footage, size of the lot, number of rooms, date of construction, etc.) and qualitative terms (building materials, style of the home, etc.). \n",
